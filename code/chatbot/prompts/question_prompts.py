{formatted_history}

Now, to gently start a new story thread, I'd like you to formulate a creative and inviting OPENING question.
This question should be inspired by the following theme: '{question_theme}'
Make it sound like a genuine, friendly invitation to share, perhaps with a touch of wonder or playfulness.
For example, if the theme is "a challenge you faced", instead of just "Tell me about a challenge", you might ask "Was there ever a time you felt like you were in a movie, facing a really tricky situation? I'd love to hear about it!" or "I'm curious, what's a hurdle you've jumped over that made you feel super proud afterwards?"
Connect to our recent chat if it feels natural, otherwise, a fresh and intriguing question on the theme is perfect.
Please output ONLY the question itself. Ensure it ends with a question mark.
